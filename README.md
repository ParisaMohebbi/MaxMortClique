* In the MILP folder:
  
  - The Python code "MILP.py" solves Model (6) in the paper.
 
* In the Enumeration folder:

   - The Python code "EnumerationAlgorithm.py" finds lethal (marginal) cliques based on Algorithm (1) in the paper.
   - The file "Results of Enumeration Algorithm.xlsx" reports comprehensive results of running Algorithm (1) for all samples and the full dataset.

* The file "Comorbidity_Network_SCI=0.05.edgelist" is the comorbidity graph edgelist.
* The complete dataset can be requested from Oklahoma State University, Center for Health Systems Innovation.
